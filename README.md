Advanced Binary Classification: Utilized SVM, linear models, boosting, neural networks, and strategic data augmentation for diverse feature sets. Enhanced efficacy through innovative imputation and encoding techniques.


**Advanced Binary Classification Toolkit**

This repository encompasses an array of sophisticated algorithms tailored for binary classification, meticulously designed to accommodate distinct feature sets. The journey begins with the utilization of Support Vector Machines (SVM), linear classifiers, and boosting algorithms. The models are fortified with diverse imputation techniques and encoding schemes, ensuring an elevated level of performance.

In the pursuit of model refinement, a diverse set of machine learning techniques is applied, ranging from neural networks with varying hidden layers to non-neural ensembles. Furthermore, Support Vector Machines (SVM) are implemented with diverse kernels, amplifying model efficacy through the strategic integration of advanced data augmentation methodologies. This toolkit is engineered to empower users in the realm of binary classification, offering a comprehensive and versatile suite of algorithms for nuanced and high-performance model development.
